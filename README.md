# Fontrivia

Fontrivia.

Fontrivia is our website that helps any other internet user to learn about all 5 different typographies that Google Fonts has to offer.
The 5 Google Font Typographies are:

1. Serif
2. Sans-Serif
3. Monospace
4. Display
5. Script/Handwriting

At the end of learning about these fonts, users will get to test themselves to see how much they've learnt about each font type and from then on will be able to choose a font for their next project. It also is a small little game from us.


## Design Process

When designing this website, the idea we had in mind was to make it as simple as possible. Our main goal was to get users to understand more about the google fonts provided to the internet from Google.

This project was mainly made for, well, everyone. Whether you are a student trying to write a report and is unsure what font to use or a full-stack developer wondering what font to use for your next website. This website caters to you!

From a developers point of view, we imagine that you using our website would go something like this:

"Oh no, I need a font to ✨Beautify✨ my website but i'm not sure which to use... I know! I will go to {this website} and find out more about fonts to use on my project!"

One website that we used when that is related to the design of the website is https://www.happyhues.co/palettes/14. We used this website to reference colour schemes to make the website look good.

<!-- Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process.
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. -->

## Features
Our website can be broken down to 11 different html pages with 2 being "filler" pages.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
  - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
